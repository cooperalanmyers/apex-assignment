Getting my environment set up for React and JS and becoming introduced to mobile app development.

Any additional tools or libraries youâ€™ve used:
VS Code
GitHub
React
JS
CSS
ChatGPT
Youtube
Command Prompt

How you structured the project:
Really just a baseline of getting a draft of this application within an hour or so. UI/UX is something I can improve on, but the raw structure is what I was interested in learning/designing.

Learning myself how to develop mobile applications, adapting to the curve of JS and CSS.
